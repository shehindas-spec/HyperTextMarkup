<p>Birds, especially parrots, crows, and ravens, are incredibly intelligent and can learn tricks, mimic sounds, and even talk.Many birds are social and enjoy companionship — both from humans and other birds. Some species do better in pairs or flocks. Birds need spacious cages to flap their wings and move around. A cramped cage can lead to stress and health problems.</p>
